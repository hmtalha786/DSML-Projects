# About the Repository

This repository is a collection of data science and machine learning projects. Some of the datasets are local while others are taken from Kaggle. Further details are given below in each section.

### Project # 1 : Big Mart Sales Prediction

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales. The <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivan118/big-mart-sales-prediction-datasets'>dataset</a> used in this project is taken from Kaggle.
